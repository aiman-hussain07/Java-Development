# Operators in Java
Symbols that tell compiler to perform some operation. Every performed operation has two major components -
1. Operator: symbols used for performing specific operations (+, -, * etc)
2. Operands:  values on which operator operates (a, b etc)

# Types of Operators
* Arithmetic Operators - used to perform simple arithmetic operations on primitive data types. 
1. Binary AO: any expression which requires two operand to perform an operation ( +, -, *, /, % ). 
2. Unary AO: requires only one operand to perform an operation ( ++, -- ).
    * Increment Operator (++) :
        1. Pre Increment O (++a) : first changes value, then will value be used.
        2. Post Increment O (a++) : first will value be used, then changed. 
    * Decrement Operator (--) :
        1. Pre Decrement O (--a) 
        2. Post Decrement O (a--) 

* Relational Operators - used to check for relations like equality, greater than, and less than. They return boolean results.
    1. ==, Equal equal to 
    2. !=, Not Equal to
    3. <, less than
    4. <=, less than or equal to 
    5. >, Greater than
    6. >=, Greater than or equal to 

* Logical Operators - used to determine the logic between variables or values 
    1. &&, Logical AND: returns true when both conditions are true.
    2. ||, Logical OR: returns true if at least one condition is true.
    3. !, Logical NOT: returns true when a condition is false and vice-versa

* Assignment Operators - used to assign a value to any variable. It has right-to-left associativity. Eg: x = 10; the assignment operator (=) assigns the value 10 to a variable x. Assignment operator combined with other operators builds a shorter version of the statement (Compound Statement), i.e.,.
    1. +=, 
    2. -=, 
    3. *=, 
    4. /=, 
    5. %=
